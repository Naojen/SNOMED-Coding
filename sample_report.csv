"Pathologic diagnosis: 1. Descending colon, anterior resection --- Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with mucinous component. Tumor invaded to muscularis propria. The bilateral cut ends and mesocolic lymph nodes (0/21) are free of tumor. 2. Soft tissue, IMA root, dissection --- Unremarkable fibrovasculoadipose tissue. No tumor seen. 3. Colon, cut end, distal, resection --- Chronic inflammation, mild. No tumor seen. Prognostic and predictive factor: 1. Tumor size: 4.2x3.4x1.7 cm. 2. Depth of invasion: Muscularis propria. 3. Histologic grade: Moderately differentiated. 4. Angiolymphatic invasion: Not identified. 5. Perineural invasion: Not identified. 6. Tumor deposits (discontinuous extramural extension): Not identified. 7. Circumferential (radial) margin (CRM): Uninvolved, 12 mm in distance. 8. Serosal margin status: Not applicable. 9. Lymph node status: Uninvolved (0/21). 10. Extranodal involvement: Not identified. 11. Tumor regression grading S/P CCRT: Not applicable. 12. Type of polyp in which invasive carcinoma arose: Not identified. 13. Additional pathologic findings: Not identified. 14. Pathological TNM Stage: pT2N0(According to the seventh edition, 2010, American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Guidelines for Tumors / 2012 CAP guideline). 15. TNM descriptors: Not applicable. Gross description: The specimen consists of 1) a descending of colon, 15.2 cm in length and 3.7 cm in proximal cut end circumference, 5.2 cm in distal circumference, and mesocolic soft tissue. A gray tan firm cauliflower polyp lesion, 4.2x3.4x1.7 cm, is noted, 3 cm to the nearest cut end. On cross section, the tumor invaded to the muscle layer with 12 mm to the circumferential margin. The both cut ends are free of tumor grossly. 2) IMA root, a piece of tan yellow soft tissue, 3.7x2.5x1.7 cm. 3) distal cut end, a piece of tan mucosa-covered soft tissue, 2.5x1.5x1 cm. Representative part for section: A) bilateral cut ends B-F) tumor G) specimen 2 H) specimen 3 J-M) lymph nodes. Note: This case has been peer reviewed by two doctors.",#T-67600,M81403
"Pathologic diagnosis: Rectum, endoscopic biopsy --- Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated. Gross description: The specimen consists of 4 pieces of tan soft tissue, less than 0.1x0.1x0.1 cm. All for section. Microscopic description: Section shows rectal mucosa with invasive carcinoma arranged in sheets growth pattern. Focal signet-ring feature is noted. Note: 1. The diagnosis is concurred in intradepartment consensus meeting on 2014/08/11. 2. This case has been peer reviewed by two doctors.",#T-68000,M81403
"Pathologic diagnosis: 1. Colon, terminal ileum, and appendix, right hemicolectomy --- Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated with signet ring cell feature, of ileocecal valve and cecum. Tumor invaded to mesocolic soft tissue. and metastasized to mesocolic lymph nodes (14/36). The appendix and bilateral cut ends are free of tumor. Ancillary study for diagnosis: 1. Special stains for PASD (+) and mucicarmine (+) are done on section E. 2. IHC stains for CK7 (-), CK20 (focal +), CDX2 (focal +), synaptophysin (-) and chromogranin (-) are done on section E. Prognostic and predictive factor: 1. Tumor size: 8x4.5 cm. 2. Depth of invasion: Mesocolic soft tissue. 3. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. 4. Angiolymphatic invasion: Present. 5. Perineural invasion: Not identified. 6. Tumor deposits (discontinuous extramural extension): Present. 7. Circumferential (radial) margin (CRM): Uninvolved, 2 mm in distance. 8. Serosal status: Uninvolved, mm in distance. 9. Lymph node status: Involved (14/36). 10. Extranodal involvement: Present. 11. Tumor regression grading S/P CCRT: Not applicable. 12. Type of polyp in which invasive carcinoma arose: Not identified. 13. Additional pathologic findings: Adenoma(s). 14. Pathological TNM Stage: pT3N2b (According to the seventh edition, 2010, American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Guidelines for Tumors / 2013 CAP guideline). 15. TNM descriptors: Not applicable. Gross description: The specimen consists of a segment of right colon, 23 cm in length, and 8 cm in proximal cut end circumference, 5.5 cm in distal circumference, and an attached segment of ileum, 12 cm in length, and 4 cm in circumference. An unremarkable appendix, 3.5 cm in length, is noted. A gray tan firm annular elevated and centrally ulcerative lesion, 8x4.5 cm, is noted on the ileocecal valve and cecum, 11.5 cm to the ileal cut end. On cross section, the tumor invaded to the mesocolon and is very close to the serosal grossly. There are also several sessile polyps, up to 1.5x1.2x0.3 cm, on the ascending colon. The appendix and both cut ends are free of tumor. Representative part for section: A-B) both cut ends C-D) appendix E-K) tumor L-M) polyps N-) lymph ndoes. Note: This case has been peer reviewed by two doctors.",#T-67100,M81403
