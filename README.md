This repository comprises the  SNOMED CT(Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) coding of colon pathology reports through prompt engineering (PRW) and Enhanced-Retrieval Augmented Generation (ERAG). This study evaluated PRW and ERAG through multiple LLMs provided by Meta-Llama 2, Llama 3 and Llama 3.1. The PRW consists of five phases

*The development of five phases of PRW*
The user prompts are developed through the five phases as shown in Figure. Each phase is developed based on addressing the error observed in the previous phase. So, in the last (5^{th}) phase, we have a comprehensive set of prompts that bring out the best of the LLama models in SNOMED coding.
